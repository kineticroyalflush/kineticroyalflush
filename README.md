    Many individuals appear to be unclear about our display name on Ponytown, which includes the phrase "do not interact true crime community." To clarify our stance, we want to emphasize 
    that we are not condemning the entire true crime community. Our message is specifically directed toward those who have an attraction to criminals, which can manifest in various ways, 
    including idolizing them or romanticizing their actions. It’s important to highlight that there is a significant distinction between having a genuine interest in the aspects of true 
    crime—such as understanding criminal psychology, the legal system, or the societal impacts of crime—and being drawn to the individuals who commit these acts. Our intention is to 
    foster a safe and respectful environment, and to encourage a healthy, critical engagement with the topic of true crime without crossing into troubling territory.

    We also have various criminal alters that may appear to be tcc that are simply uncomfortable with those type of people around them.
